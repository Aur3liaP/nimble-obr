# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Owlbear Rodeo (OBR) extension: a real-time-synced character sheet panel for the **Nimble** TTRPG. React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4, using `@owlbear-rodeo/sdk` v3.1.0. Single project (no monorepo), pure static SPA, no backend, no env vars.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` : Vite dev server on `https://localhost:5173` (HTTPS via self-signed cert; register the manifest at `https://localhost:5173/manifest.json` in OBR's Extensions panel to test)
- `npm run build` : `tsc -b && vite build`
- `npm run type-check` : `tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run lint` : `eslint . --ext ts,tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0`
- **No test suite exists** (no vitest/jest/playwright configured). `type-check` + `lint` passing is the bar for "done". Changes touching permissions, sync, or roll flow need manual multiplayer verification in OBR (multiple accounts). Flag this rather than claiming it's tested.

## Architecture

- **No backend.** Persistence is entirely via the OBR SDK:
  - Character sheet: per-token item metadata, key `com.nimble-obr.nimble/character_sheet` (`METADATA_KEY` in `src/types/character.ts`), written via `OBR.scene.items.updateItems()`.
  - Shared roll log: scene metadata (`ROLL_LOG_KEY = ${METADATA_KEY}/roll_log`), capped at 20 entries.
- HTTPS is mandatory even for local dev (OBR loads extensions in an iframe requiring HTTPS). `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl` is loaded only when `command === 'serve'` in `vite.config.ts`, never in production builds.
- `OBR.isAvailable` is checked before `OBR.onReady(...)` since the app also runs fine outside an OBR host during plain `vite dev`/build.
- Only items with `layer === "CHARACTER"` are treated as valid character tokens (selection filtering in `useOBR.ts`).
- `useOBR` is the single integration point with the SDK and central state hook. It exposes both a `permissions` object and deprecated top-level `canEdit`/`isGM` fields kept only for incremental migration. Read from `permissions.canEdit`/`permissions.isGM` in new code, not the deprecated fields.
- IDs are always generated with `crypto.randomUUID()`.
- Mutually exclusive row states use the `expandedId` / `editingId` pattern.

### Structural constraints (do not refactor away)

These exist because of bugs already diagnosed and fixed. Changing them reintroduces the bug.

- **`App.tsx` is a single JSX tree, not multiple early-return branches.** `DicePanel` must never unmount, or in-progress dice state is lost whenever `selectionState` changes. Consolidating the tree is the fix; "improving readability" with early returns undoes it.
- **The roll log has a single source of truth.** Pushing a visible roll writes to `OBR.scene.setMetadata` only; local `recentRolls` state is updated **only** by the `onMetadataChange` listener, never directly by the push function. The double update remounts conditional UI in `App.tsx`. Hidden (GM-only) rolls are the deliberate exception: they skip scene metadata and go straight to local state.
- **Drag interactions keep local state during the drag and commit once on release.** Writing to OBR on every `mousemove` floods the network. Resync protection when external changes arrive mid-drag is required, not optional.
- **Tailwind cannot compile dynamic class names.** When `colorClass` is a function, use an inline `style` prop, not a computed class string.

### Permission model

| Role | Can edit |
|---|---|
| Token owner (player, matches `ownerId`) | Their own sheet |
| GM | Any sheet, regardless of `ownerId` |
| Other player | Read-only (edit controls hidden, not disabled) |

- `permissions` (`{ canEdit, isGM, isOwner, isUnclaimed }`) is computed once in `useOBR` and passed explicitly as **props** to every interactive component, deliberately not exposed via React context. Any new component needing it must have it threaded through manually.
- `updateCharacter` re-checks `canEdit` before every write and no-ops with `console.warn` if the caller lacks rights. This is **not a real security boundary** (OBR has no server-side ACL on metadata); it only guards against accidental stale-UI writes.
- Rolling dice is intentionally **not** gated by `canEdit`. A read-only viewer can roll using another character's stats. Only persisting sheet changes is guarded. This is a design decision, not an oversight.
- Claiming or taking over a sheet is also intentionally **not** gated. Any player can currently take over another player's claimed sheet (deliberate design for a trusted table). If GM-only claiming is ever wanted, add the guard at the call site (`App.tsx`/`CharacterHeader.tsx`), not in `useOBR`.

### Formula parser (`src/utils/formulaParser.ts`)

Hand-rolled recursive-descent parser. **Never use `eval()` or `Function()`** here, by design, to avoid arbitrary code execution from a player- or GM-typed formula. Preserve the existing safety limits when touching it: `MAX_FORMULA_LENGTH = 200`, `MAX_PARSE_DEPTH = 30`, `MAX_DICE_COUNT = 100`, `MAX_DICE_SIDES = 1000`. Syntax supports dice (`1d8`), stats (`STR/DEX/INT/WIL`), `KEY`/`FLAW`, skills, `LEVEL`, arithmetic, `floor()`/`ceil()`/`min()`/`max()`, and dynamic dice (`incrementdice(1, level)d12`, `stepdice(...)`).

## Code style

- 2-space indentation, semicolons.
- `src/` app code uses **double quotes**; root config files (`vite.config.ts`, `eslint.config.js`) use single quotes. Match whichever file you're editing rather than applying one style everywhere.
- Functional components only, typed via `interface XProps { ... }` above the component, with defaults destructured in the signature.
- Every file has a substantial `@file` JSDoc header explaining its role; every exported function/type/interface has JSDoc (`@remarks`, `@param`, `@returns`, `@see`, `@deprecated`, `{@link Name}` as relevant). Preserve this convention in new files.
- Type-only imports use `import type { ... }` (enforced by `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`).
- `useRef` is used deliberately in `useOBR` to give callbacks access to latest state without stale closures (`characterRef`, `canEditRef`, `playerIdRef`). Callbacks otherwise close over values captured at effect-registration time.
- Tailwind v4 is configured via CSS in `src/index.css` (`@tailwindcss/vite` plugin). There is no `tailwind.config.js`.
- Shared UI primitives live in `src/components/ui/common/` and are re-exported via its `index.ts` barrel.
- Extract a shared component only when the pattern repeats in 3+ places. Avoid speculative abstraction.

## Conventions

- Commit messages use a `type: description` prefix. Use `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`. Avoid `update:`, which appears in older history but is not part of Conventional Commits.
- Code and documentation are in English. Conversation with the maintainer is in French.
- **In user-facing prose (README, `docs/store.md`, UI copy): do not use em dashes or en dashes.** Use commas, colons, or parentheses. Em dashes read as AI-generated.
- `docs/store.md` is the OBR extension store listing (front matter + markdown for the marketplace), not internal docs. Its `tags` must stay within the store's allowed vocabulary, and `manifest`/`image`/`icon` URLs must stay in sync with the deployed URL (`nimble-obr.vercel.app`).
